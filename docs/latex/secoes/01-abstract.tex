\section{abstract}
  Flappy Bird is an electronic game created in 2013. The objective in the game is to earn as many points as possible by controlling a bird, without letting it crash into the pipes. In this work, reinforcement learning techniques will be used to automatically divert the flap bird between the pipes. The OpenIA Gym toolkit will be used. OpenIA Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games.
